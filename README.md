# LIRI Bot

As a close relative of Siri, Liri will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies. I especially liked creating this app, as it was difficult and took me out of my comfort zone. It is written in Javascript using NodeJS and some other handy libraries.

### Overview

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
